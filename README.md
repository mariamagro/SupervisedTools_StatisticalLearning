**Author:** María Ángeles Magro Garrote  
**Year:** 2022

## Overview

This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict house rents using a dataset of house rental listings. The project involves both classification and regression approaches to predict the target variable: the rent of houses. The dataset includes various predictors which are explored to understand their relationship with the target variable.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project was created by Sourav Banerjee. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset).
